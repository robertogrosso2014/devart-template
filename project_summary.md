## Description
Feeling Good is a story. Not an ordinary story. You will see it divided in 3 moments in time, where the couple is more vulnerable. The viewer will pass through the installation powered by Kinect sensors that will define which sections to play and, by interacting with it, different parts of the story will be revealed. Love, lies, desperation, pride, satisfaction and relief are the nature of the installation.
